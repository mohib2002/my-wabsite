<h3>Etymology</h3><hr>
<p>The name Kuakata originated from the word 'kua' — the Bengali word for "well" which was dug on the seashore by the early Rakhine settlers(Burmese tribes) in quest of collecting drinking water.[4] They landed on the Kuakata coast in the 18th century after being expelled from Arakan (Myanmar) by the Burmese extremists .[5] Afterwards, it has become a tradition of digging wells in the neighbourhoods of Rakhaine tribes for water.</p><br>
